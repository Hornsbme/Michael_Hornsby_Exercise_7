Michael Hornsby Exercise Set 7

# Number 1
This code chunk below creates my funtion

I spent about 5 hours trying to figure out why my one fuction would not return the 
data set 'my_data' to the global environment.  Seeing as how I couldn't figure that out, 
I just combined everything into one function to give the closest possible answer.

```{r}
#Load the car package
library(car)

my.function <- function(xvar, yvar, p) {
  
# Create the model and residuals
  
model <- lm(yvar ~ xvar)

residuals <- residuals(model)

my_data <- as.data.frame(cbind(xvar, yvar, residuals))

# Create an order vector and order the residuals from largest to smallest
order_vector <- order(abs(my_data$residuals), decreasing = TRUE)

my_data <- my_data[order_vector,]

# Create the logical vector, add it to my data set, and return the data set

logical_vector <- (c(rep(TRUE, p), rep(FALSE,length(my_data$xvar) - p)))

my_data$outcome <- logical_vector

my_data <- data.frame(my_data)

# This creates the scatterplot with the regline.

scatterplot(x = my_data$xvar, y = my_data$yvar, regLine = TRUE, groups = my_data$outcome)
}

# load the iris data and run the function.  The iris data has 150 observations, 
# so I used p to be 15, or 10% of those  I used Sepal Length as x and 
# Petal Length as y.
data("iris")

my.function(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Petal.Length, 15)
```

Also, I couldn't figure out how to have the one regline without the curved reglines.
I'm not really happy with how this script turned out, but I'll use a stressbuster for 
a regrade if my grade turns out too low.
